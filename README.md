# AIMOS-D
Artificial Intelligence Models for Organizing Spectral Data.

Machine learning tools for classifying rotational/THz spectra

## Classification of THz spectra
Workflows are presented for classification of THz spectra

## Classification of IR spectra using SVM
Workflows are presented for classification of THz spectra

## Classification and quantification of Mixture Components using NNs
Workflows are presented for classification of THz spectra

## Classification of THz spectra using Deep/Convolutional Neural Networks
Workflows are presented for classification using DNNs and CNNs

## Unsupervised classification and clustering of spectra
Workflows for label-free classification and clustering of spectral data
tSNE, PCA and kmeans are implemented. Need to implement autoencoders to visualize clustering.
