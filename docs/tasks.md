Outstanding tasks

Time series segmentation
1D-CNN
1D-VAE
reduces dimension from 229, encodes information into only 3 numbers which can be plotted and compared.
Try the above


A function that calculates ROC and plots ROC curves for multiclass

Filter by index function for IR dataset

A class and functions for 1D VAE/U-net

A class and functions for 2D VAE/U-net

1D VAE denoiser.

A function that plots the feature maps conveniently.

Feature visualization technique zeiler paper (apply it to 1D CNN)

Read the 1D Survey paper.

Feature visualization technique 2 (feed randomly generated images to CNN to maximize the activation of a particular neuron)

Do literature search on feature visualization of 1D CNNs.

1D disentangled autoencoders may be nice too.
